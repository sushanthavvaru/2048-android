Application is a math game. When you swipe on the big box. The numbers get added in the direction of swipe. Keeping playing until
you reach 2048 number tile. The application is created using onDraw method of Activity and canvas. Further improvements that can 
be done is adding animation and background music to the application. The application runs best on a phone. Nexux 5 phone would be
better. It also has music running while playing game. App is loaded with sound effetcs.
